Graceful degradation and service workers are related, as graceful degradation has a focus on the interactivity of an application, and large-sized files such as scripts, images, and data are a big part of that. Service workers ensures consistency and reliability in interactivity of an application, as networks and internet access can be largely inconsistent depending on the device's hardware, and setting. Service workers remove that inconsistency from internet access by caching important larger files like scripts and images that may take a while to load on poor connections, ensuring consistent, quick connectivity on repeated accesses, therefore improving interactivity.
